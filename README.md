# Churn Prediction
In this project, i predict whether someone who subscribe will get churn or not. I did some EDA about the dataset. Finally, i also test some model using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier and chose Support Vector Classifier as the final model. I also tried to deploy the model to Streamlit but it's still in development
